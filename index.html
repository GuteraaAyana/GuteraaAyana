        <p id="bio">  My name is Guteraa Ayana and I am a student at Emory University studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. 
            My passion for computers and programming as a whole started when my dad introducted me Khan Academy. 
            While he expected me to be working on my math, reading, and science topics, I was alway in the programming section whittling away at the vast array of videos. 
            Fast-foward ten years and now I'm in university studying the same topic I was obsessed with all those years ago. If you don't find me on my bed, laptop on my chest, 
            refining my skills you will probably find me at my desktop playing Modded Minecraft discovering new ways to make the most mundane task as quick as possible, each second at a time. 
            If not using device of some sort, I might be outside biking...or shoveling snow depending on the season!
