            <p> My name is Guteraa Ayana and I am a student at Emory University studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. </p>

            <p>My passion for computers and programming as a whole started when my dad introduced me to Khan Academy. While he expected me to be working on my math, reading, and science topics, I was always in the programming section whittling away at the vast array of videos.</p>

            <p>Fast-forward ten years and now I'm in university studying the same topic I was obsessed with all those years ago. If you don't find me on my bed, laptop on my chest, refining my skills you will probably find me at my desktop playing Modded Minecraft discovering new ways to make the most mundane task as quick as possible, each second at a time. If not using device of some sort, I might be outside biking...or shoveling snow depending on the season!</p>

                <h3>Soccer Analytics Research: Goal-Scoring Pattern Analysis</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Analyzed goal-scoring patterns across 21 professional soccer leagues to identify temporal trends and tactical shifts in the sport.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Built a regression-based statistical model using Python to process and analyze thousands of matches. Created automated data pipelines with SLURM for large-scale computation and generated visualizations revealing significant patterns in goal timing and frequency.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> Discovered that goal-scoring probability increases as matches progress, with significantly fewer goals than expected in the early minutes of each half (χ² ≈ 288.62, p = 3.72 × 10⁻²¹). Identified "bursty" goal-scoring behavior where teams are more likely to score consecutive goals shortly after their previous goal, revealing temporal clustering patterns that deviate from random expectation. Analysis of 3,433 matches across 21 leagues demonstrates that goal timing is context-dependent, influenced by factors like fatigue, tactical shifts, and psychological momentum.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), SLURM, Git, Statistical Regression Modeling</p>
                
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Research published as a pre-print on arXiv, demonstrating reproducible methodology for sports performance analysis.</p>
